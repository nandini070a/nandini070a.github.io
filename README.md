This is my first try at github !

My github pages repo can be found at : https://github.com/nandini070a/nandini070a.github.io

In NandiniPortfolio.html, I have captured my various project work on HTML, CSS, Javascript, Photoshop and Flash from my previous work experience. In this portfolio, I only have the 
source code for the PwC Our World website. For the rest of my work, I have provided the Url's which are laready in the public domain as I don't have the source codes for those of my
previous project work.
